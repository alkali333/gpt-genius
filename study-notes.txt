UseQuery has isPending, isError, and data. 
It takes a querykey, and any function that returns a promise. 
Once the promise is resolved, the data is available in data. 


UseMutation - we use this when we want to mutate data on the server
(create, edit, delete). It is similar to useQuery but has a UseMutation
function that returns a promise. IT has mutate function, onsuccess, on isError

It's a bit harder than other react stuff because we use server actions, 
we can directly use server actions within our react code, because they 
return a promise - it is mindboggling to be able to use server actions 
in client code! 


const { mutate, isPending, data } = useMutation

mutate is the function to be called, data is the resulting data
useMutation has side effects like onSuccess, onError so we do 
updates to the ui or whatever
